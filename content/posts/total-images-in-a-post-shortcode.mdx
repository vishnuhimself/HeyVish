Here's a shortcode to get the total number of images in a post in WordPress.

<Shortcode code="[post_image_count]" />

## Code for the shortcode

```php
//Total Images in a post
function sw_post_image_count(){
    $wall_count = count( get_attached_media( 'image', $post->ID ) );
    return $wall_count - 1;
}
add_shortcode('post_image_count','sw_post_image_count');
```

Wherever you want to display the total images at post level, you can simply use the `[post_image_count]` shortcode.

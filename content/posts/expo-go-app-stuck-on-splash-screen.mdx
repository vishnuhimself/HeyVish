While developing a React Native app with Expo, I encountered an issue where my app would get stuck on the splash screen. This can happen in different scenarios:

- During development in Expo Go
- In production builds
- After upgrading Expo SDK
- In iOS simulator or TestFlight builds

Let me share all the solutions that worked for me and others in the community.

## Quick Solutions to Try First

1. **Clear Expo Cache and Restart**
```bash
# Clear cache
expo start -c

# If using yarn
yarn start --clear
```

2. **Remove node_modules and Reinstall**
```bash
# Remove existing dependencies
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json # or yarn.lock if using yarn

# Reinstall
npm install # or yarn install
```

## Common Causes and Solutions

### 1. React Native Screens Not Installed

One common cause is missing or improperly installed `react-native-screens`. Here's how to fix it:

```bash
# Install react-native-screens
npx expo install react-native-screens

# Add this import at the top of your App.js/App.tsx
import 'react-native-screens/native-screens';
```

### 2. Incorrect Import Statements

Sometimes auto-imports can cause this issue. Check for and fix any incorrect imports:

```typescript
// ❌ Incorrect import
import { useState } from 'react/cjs/react.development';

// ✅ Correct import
import { useState } from 'react';
```

### 3. UUID Resolution Issues

If you're using UUID in your project, remove it from resolutions in package.json:

```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    // ❌ Remove this if present
    "uuid": "^8.3.2"
  }
}
```

### 4. Modal or Alert on App Launch

If you're showing a modal or alert immediately when the app launches, it can cause the splash screen to hang:

```typescript
// ❌ Problematic code
const App = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    Alert.alert('Welcome!') // This can cause splash screen to hang
  }, [])
  // ...
}

// ✅ Better approach
const App = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      Alert.alert('Welcome!')
    }, 1000)
    return () => clearTimeout(timer)
  }, [])
  // ...
}
```

### 5. Xcode Related Issues (iOS)

If you're facing this on iOS, try:

```bash
# Reset Xcode path
sudo xcode-select --reset

# Or set the correct path
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

### 6. Debug Statements

Remove any debugger statements in your code as they can cause hanging:

```typescript
// ❌ Remove these
debugger;
console.debug();
```

## Production Build Specific Solutions

### 1. Clean Build Directories

```bash
# For iOS
cd ios
rm -rf build
pod install

# For Android
cd android
./gradlew clean
```

### 2. Check SplashScreen Configuration

Make sure your splash screen is properly configured in app.json:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "splash": {
      "image": "./assets/splash.png",
      "resizeMode": "contain",
      "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Manual Splash Screen Control

If you're manually controlling the splash screen, ensure proper implementation:

```typescript
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';

// Keep splash screen visible while we fetch resources
SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();

const App = () => {
  const [appIsReady, setAppIsReady] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function prepare() {
      try {
        // Pre-load fonts, make API calls, etc.
        await loadResourcesAsync();
      } catch (e) {
        console.warn(e);
      } finally {
        setAppIsReady(true);
      }
    }

    prepare();
  }, []);

  const onLayoutRootView = useCallback(async () => {
    if (appIsReady) {
      await SplashScreen.hideAsync();
    }
  }, [appIsReady]);

  if (!appIsReady) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <View onLayout={onLayoutRootView}>
      {/* Your app content */}
    </View>
  );
};
```

## Development Environment Fixes

1. **Update Expo CLI**
```bash
npm install -g expo-cli@latest
```

2. **Update Expo Go App**
Delete and reinstall the Expo Go app on your device/simulator.

## Prevention Tips

To prevent this issue in future:

1. Always use the latest stable versions of Expo SDK and dependencies
2. Test thoroughly after adding new dependencies
3. Keep development environment updated
4. Use expo-doctor to check for common issues:
```bash
npx expo-doctor
```

## When Nothing Works

If none of the above solutions work:

1. Create a new Expo project
2. Gradually move your code to the new project
3. Compare configurations between working and non-working projects
4. Check for differences in dependencies and versions

Remember to always test your app thoroughly after applying any of these fixes, especially before deploying to production.

Here's a shortcode to get the total number of images in your WordPress site:

<Shortcode code="[total_images]" />

## Code for the shortcode

```php
//Total Images in Site
function total_images_count(){
    $args = array(
        'post_type' => 'attachment',
        'post_mime_type' => 'image',
        'post_status' => 'inherit',
        'posts_per_page' => -1,
    );
    $query_images = new WP_Query($args);
    return $query_images->post_count;
}
add_shortcode('total_images', 'total_images_count');
```

Wherever you want to display the total number of images in your site, you can simply use the `[total_images]` shortcode.

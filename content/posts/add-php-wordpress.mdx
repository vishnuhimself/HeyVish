There are two ways to add PHP code to WordPress. You can either use a plugin or add the code directly in the functions.php file of your theme. Let's look at both the options here.

## Add PHP Code to WordPress using a Plugin

You can use a plugin to easily add PHP Code to your WordPress website. **This is the method I recommend for beginners.** It's simple and straightforward. 

And I personally use (and highly recommend) Code Snippets Plugin to get the job done:

<LinkCard 
  href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/"
  title="Code Snippets"
/>

You can simply install this plugin from WordPress Plugin Repository.

Once installed:
1. Click on the 'Snippets' from the left admin bar menu
2. Click on 'Add New' at the top
3. Give your code a title (for your reference)
4. Paste the PHP code
5. Click 'Activate'

## Add PHP Code to WordPress using functions.php

If you are using a child theme and know what you are doing, you can follow this approach.

1. First click on **Appearance** > **Theme File Editor**
2. Next, click on 'functions.php' and add your code in this file

**Note**: Make sure you're using a child theme before editing functions.php directly. This ensures your changes won't be lost during theme updates.

If you've recently upgraded to Next.js 15 and encountered this error:

```bash
Error: Route "/xxx/[slug]" used `params.slug`. `params` should be awaited before using its properties.
```

Don't worry! I ran into this exact same issue while building this blog. Let me explain what's happening and how to fix it.

## Understanding the Error

In Next.js 15, several APIs that were previously synchronous have been made asynchronous. This includes:
- The `params` and `searchParams` props in pages and layouts
- `cookies()`, `draftMode()`, and `headers()` from `next/headers`

This change was introduced to improve the framework's performance and reliability. However, it means we need to modify how we access these values in our code.

## The Problem in Action

Here's what my blog post page looked like before:

```typescript
export default function BlogPost({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const post = getPostBySlug(params.slug) // This now throws an error
  // ...
}
```

The error occurs because we're trying to access `params.slug` directly without awaiting the params object first.

## How to Fix It

The solution is to await the params object before accessing its properties. Here's how I fixed it:

```typescript
export default async function BlogPost({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const { slug } = await params
  const post = getPostBySlug(slug)
  // ...
}
```

The same applies to metadata generation:

```typescript
export async function generateMetadata({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const { slug } = await params
  const post = getPostBySlug(slug)
  // ...
}
```

## Best Practices

Here are some tips I learned while fixing this issue:

1. **Make the Component Async**: Any component that needs to access params needs to be async.
2. **Destructure After Await**: It's cleaner to destructure the values after awaiting the params.
3. **Consider Static Generation**: If you're using `generateStaticParams()`, you might want to evaluate if you need dynamic params at all.

## Client Components

If you need to access these values in a client component, you'll need to use `React.use()` instead:

```typescript
'use client'
import * as React from 'react'

function ClientPage({ params }) {
  const { slug } = React.use(params)
  return <div>{slug}</div>
}
```

## Automated Fix

Next.js provides a codemod to automatically fix many instances of this error:

```bash
npx @next/codemod@canary next-async-request-api .
```

However, I recommend understanding the changes and making them manually for critical parts of your application.

## Why This Change Matters

This change in Next.js 15 is part of a broader effort to make the framework more performant and predictable. By making these APIs asynchronous:
- The framework can better optimize rendering
- Server components can handle dynamic data more efficiently
- The code becomes more explicit about its asynchronous nature

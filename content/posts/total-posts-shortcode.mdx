Here's a shortcode to get the total number of posts in WordPress:

<Shortcode code="[total_posts]" />

## Code for the shortcode

```php
//Total Posts
function total_posts_count() {
    $count_posts = wp_count_posts();
    return $count_posts->publish;
}
add_shortcode('total_posts', 'total_posts_count');
```

Wherever you want to display the total number of posts, you can simply use the `[total_posts]` shortcode.
